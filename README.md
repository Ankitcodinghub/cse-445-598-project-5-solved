<h1>Introduction</h1>
The aim of this assignment is to make sure that you understand and are familiar with the concepts covered in the lectures, including the Web application architecture, components and structure, controls, and state management.

This is an individual assignment. Each student must complete and submit independent work. No cooperation is allowed. You must use WebStrar to host your files, services, and application. The entire project must be submitted into the Canvas AND into the WebStrar server.

<h1>Practice Exercises (No submission required)</h1>
No submission is required for this part of exercises. However, doing these exercises can help you better understand the concepts and thus help you in quizzes or exams.

<ol>
<li>Reading: Textbook Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 section 6.2.</li>
<li>Do the multiple choice exercises in text for Chapter 5 and Chapter 6.</li>
<li>What kinds of Web-based computing models exist? Where is the computation (client side or server side) done in each of the models?</li>
<li>Explain how the files in ASP .Net Website application are organized in the application folder.</li>
<li>Explain what types of files exist in an ASP .Net Website application and what the functions of each type file are.</li>
<li>How do we create a user control, and how do we include the user control into a Web page?</li>
<li>What is the most frequently used function of the Global.asax file?</li>
<li>What kinds of state-saving mechanism exist, and what are the main features of each kind state-saving mechanism?</li>
<li>What is the most general state variable in ASP .Net? What type of data can be stored in this kind of state variable?</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<ol start="10">
<li>Compare and contrast the state management mechanisms: View State, Cookie, Session State, Application State, and Caching variables.</li>
<li>Discuss the relationship between the dependency and callback in the insert() method of Cache class.</li>
<li>How are dynamic graphics generated and maintained in ASP .Net environment? Read text section</li>
</ol>
5.6.

<ol start="13">
<li>What is the execution model of ASP .Net application in the tightly managed Web server?</li>
<li>Study for the questions 2 through 12 in text section 5.8, and study the questions 2 through 15 in text section 6.5. Make sure that you understand these questions and can briefly answer these questions. Study the material covered in these questions can help you prepare for the quiz and exam, and can help you understand the homework assignment.</li>
<li>Having learned all the techniques that you need to build Web applications, now, you need develop your own Web application. Brainstorm among the team members and come up with your ideas of developing a sensible Web application. Ideally, this project solves a problem that you always wanted to solve, for example
<ul>
<li>Managing membership, finance, and activities of the club that you are an officer.</li>
<li>Managing your hobby collections: When was each item purchased, price, current value.</li>
<li>Loyalty center: allow businesses to check loyalty of a costumer based on buying history and habit;</li>
<li>Developing a Web testing tool: analyzes a Web page at a given URL and calls the links in the page to discover broken links;</li>
<li>An online store with recommendation list, like Amazon, eBay, etc.,</li>
<li>A mobile application to manage your shopping list and best places to buy, taking into account time, driving distances, and cost.</li>
<li>Combine this project with your other course projects. In this case, you need to clearly state what part is submitted for this course, and what part is submitted for another course.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Project Description (Submission Required)</h1>
In this project, you will develop a service-oriented Web application with access control. The application must simulate a realistic application for the end users. The architecture is shown in the following figure.

The system must be implemented as a <strong>Website</strong> application and must be deployed to the given Web server. You may implement the application that you have outlined in project 3. You may choose to implement a different application. The code must be well commented. The application implemented must meet the following organizational, architectural, and functional requirements. The composed Website must have at least the following layers of components.

<ul>
<li>Presentation/GUI layer, consisting of ASPX pages and server controls, which allow users to interact with the application. The application must have at least these four ASPX pages: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10 points]
<ol start="3">
<li>Public page. In this page, you must introduce clearly what application the system offers, how end users can sign up for the services, how the users (TA) can test this application and the required test cases/inputs. All the components and services used in the application must be listed in a ‚ÄúService Directory‚Äù, similar to the one that you created in Assignment 3. The directory must include provider name (member who is responsible for the component), type (Web service, DLL function, user control, etc.), operation name, parameters and types, return type, function description, and link to TryIt page. You can combine the TryIt pages into your application logic.</li>
<li>Member page: In this page, you must introduce clearly what application and functions the system offers. Users can register (self-subscribe) to obtain the access to this page. It is optional to use an image verifier when a user registers. You use create access control component and store the credentials in an XML file.</li>
<li>Two staff pages: These two pages must have authentication and authorization access control. Some staff members can access one page, and other staff members can access the other page. The user</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

ID and password must be stored in an XML file. You are not allowed to use the built-in account management in order to exercise XML manipulation learned in Chapter 4.

<ol>
<li>In addition to submit the code that implements this question, you must submit the Service Directory that lists all your components, so that we can test your components. The page must have a TryIt function for each component that you developed. If a component is implicitly used and is not visible/testable from your integrated GUI, you must add a test page to make it testable</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Local component layer. This layer consists of the following two types of components. You can choose to implement one of the types: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10 points]
<ol>
<li>User control, use it to implement a sensible function of your choice.</li>
<li>DLL class library modules, to implement at least the encryption/decryption functions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
You must implement at least one of the components. You may choose more components or other type of components in order to implement your business logic.

<ul>
<li>Remote service layer. This layer consists of at least one sensible Web service developed by you and one service discovered from a public repository (this service can be from the ASU repository). Selfdeveloped services must be deployed into WebStrar.</li>
</ul>
It is the developers‚Äô (your) responsibility to make sure that the services are available and reliable when the TAs grade the assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [10 points]

<ul>
<li>Data management layer consists of <strong>both</strong> temporary states (session state and cache) <strong>and</strong> permanent states (XML file and database). [10 points]
<ol>
<li>Permanent state (XML file) for storing the user names and passwords of self-subscribed users.</li>
<li>Permanent states (XML file) for storing staff user ID, password, and role for authentication and authorization.</li>
<li>Cookie for storing user profile and Session state for storing temporary states for sharing among the sessions</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
You must implement at least two of the items in the list above.

<ul>
<li>Deploy all the components into the WebStrar server for testing. If your application is not deployed into WebStrar, but running on localhost, you will not have this 10 points. [10 points]</li>
<li>Submit complete code (Solution) into Canvas for grading (code reading). If your application is deployed into WebStrar, but not submitted into Canvas, you will still receive zero grade for the entire assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Submission Summary</h1>
You submit the following work (answers to all questions) into the Canvas submission site AND deploy all work into the WebStrar. We will read code from your Canvas submission and test your code from WebStrar.

Question 1: You must submit the Service Directory that lists all your components, so that we can test your components. The page must have a TryIt function for each component that you developed. If a component is implicitly used and is not visible/testable from your integrated GUI, you must add a test page to make it testable. You must include the code into the Solution that you submit.

Question 2: You must include the local components that you have developed into the Solution that you submit.

Question 3: You must link the Web service that you have developed, or that you have discovered into the Solution that you submit.

Question 4: You must include the state management component that you have developed into the Solution that you submit.

Question 5: Deployment. All code must be deployed into WebStrar. If your code is running on localhost only, you will not receive the deployment points.

Question 6: Submit the entire Solution into Canvas for grading (code reading). If no submission in the Canvas, your assignment will not be graded, and you will receive 0 grade.
